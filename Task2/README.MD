# Console-Based To-Do Application (Python)

A simple console-based to-do list application built with Python.  
The program runs in the terminal and uses a text file to persist tasks between runs.

## Features
- View all tasks
- Add new tasks
- Remove tasks by number
- Tasks are saved to a file (`tasks.txt`) so they remain after the program exits

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Console / command-line interaction
- Python lists for in-memory data storage
- File handling (`open`, read, write)
- Input validation and control flow
- Modular code using functions

## How to Run
1. Open the project folder in a terminal
2. Run pyton:


# 📝 Console-Based To-Do Application (Python)

A beginner-level console-based to-do list application built in Python.  
The program runs in the terminal and allows users to manage tasks that persist between sessions using a text file.

## Features
- View all tasks
- Add new tasks
- Remove tasks by number
- Persistent storage using a text file (`tasks.txt`)
- Menu-driven console interaction
- Basic input validation
- f String 

## Learning Reference
Reference used:
1. Youtube

  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHma55qSnXY

2. ChatGPT to:
  - Understand file handling concepts (`open`, read, write)
  - Learn how to use lists for data storage
  - Understand control flow (`if / elif / else`, `while True`)
  - Implement input validation
  - Structure the program using functions
  - Summarize the project and create the README (I also edited this)

## What I Learned
- How console-based applications work
- How to use Python lists to manage data
- How to read from and write to files for data persistence
- The purpose of `while True` loops and `break`
- Input validation 
- Modularizing code using functions
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Improved my workflow using VS Code and the command line

## Tech Stack
- VS Code
- Python 3
- Windows Terminal
