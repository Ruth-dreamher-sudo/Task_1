# Console-Based To-Do Application (Python)

A simple console-based to-do list application built with Python.  
The program runs in the terminal and uses a text file to persist tasks between runs.

## Features
- View all tasks
- Add new tasks
- Remove tasks by number
- Tasks are saved to a file (`tasks.txt`) so they remain after the program exits

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Console / command-line interaction
- Python lists for in-memory data storage
- File handling (`open`, read, write)
- Input validation and control flow
- Modular code using functions

## How to Run
1. Open the project folder in a terminal
2. Run pyton:
